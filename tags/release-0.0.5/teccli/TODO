* So much to do I don't even know where to start. Here's a
  couple of things that come to mind:

* Re-activate plugins; implement JE-based subcorpus selection to
  replace SQL server on tec-server

* separate GUI from Browser (move GUI into gui/ package)

* re-implement ConcArray based on a ('growable') collection class
  rather than array

* implement merging of corpus sources (i.e. the ability to spawn
  several ConcordanceThread's and collate the downloads into a single
  ConcArray for display by a single ListDisplay

* fix scrollbars in ListDisplay (draw list renderers on a
  ScrollablePane) 

* Implement visualisation and direct manipulation plugins (for
  subcorpus selection etc)
