	* Dictionary.java, WordQuery.java: Added positional index table
	TPosTable.java, which stores the byte offset of each token in a
	file. TPosTable.java enables Dictionary to search for n-grams with
	intervening contexts completely off-line (i.e. without having to
	read or download the original text file). This is done through
	Dictionary.matchConcordance(). Note that
	WordQuery.matchConcordance() (which does on-line search) is no
	longer used by Dictionary and will be deprecated in future
	releases. Created classes Horizon.java, which store the
	specification of allowable words (and their file offsets) to the
	left or right of the main (least frequent) keyword, and and
	PrepContextQuery.java which stores left and right Horizons
	pre-compiled for a specific file.

	* (All) Moved modnlp.idx.{InterSet,WordForms} to modnlp.dstruct
	  so they can be shared with tc and tec.

2006-07-15  S. Luz  <luzs@cs.tcd.ie>

	* (All) Started idx as a sub-module of modnlp, with its separate
	  Makefile etc. Changed directory structure in preparation for
	  SVN.
