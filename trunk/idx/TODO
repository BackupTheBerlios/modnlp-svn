* use JE transactions to guarantee atomicity in
  Dictionary.addToDictionary() and Dictionary.removeFromDictionary().

* modnlp.idx.query.WordQuery.matchConcordance() really belongs in
  modnlp.idx.database.Dictionary. Check potential backward compat
  problems in tec-server and deprecate WordQuery.matchConcordance() in
  favour of Dictionary.matchConcordance().

* In fact, much (perhaps most) of the functionality in
  modnlp.idx.query.WordQuery should be moved into
  modnlp.idx.database.Dictionary. Ideally, Dictionary should handle
  the functionality currently implemented in
  modnlp.idx.query.WordQuery.matchConcordance() and auxiliary methods,
  leaving only query parsing and related methods for WordQuery. This
  hasn't been done yet to preserve backward compatibility with
  tec-server
