* replace sequential search in the posa loops in matchConcordance() by
  binary search to make them more efficient: currently linear on the
  number of tokens in the file (posa.length) when it could be
  logarithmic.

* Implement preferences pane for modnlp.idx.IndexManager, including
  settings for local header directory, header's  URL (for external
  access), tag ignore regexp, tokenisation regexp etc.
