modnlp-idx, binary distribution: 
-------------------------------

The modnlp text indexing suite is distributed under the
GNU General Public License. See COPYING for details.

modnlp-idx is fully compatible with the GNU Classpath
(http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/) and I intend to keep it that
way.  It has been tested on a kaffe (v1.1.5), and partially tested on
sablevm (v1.1.6), jamvm (v1.3), with the gnu.regexp package. It also
runs on Sun's JDK version 1.4 or greater.

The source code, API documentation is available from 

  http://modnlp.berlios.de/

In order to run the Indexing utility (to generate a TEC-compatible
index) simply click/double-click on idx.jar or, on the command line,
type:

 % java -jar idx.jar

To query the index, type

 % java -cp idx.jar:gnu-regexp-1.1.4.jar:je.jar modnlp.idx.Query INDEX-DIRECTORY -q

and eenter your query at the '>' prompt. E.g. 

 > the

should return lines containing the query term ("the")
surrounded by its immediate context (50 chars).
