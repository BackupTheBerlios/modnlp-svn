	* idx, teccli, tecser: New releases coincinding with the first
	release of the TEC Corpus (v2). A Corpus description plugin
	(CorpusDescriptionBrowser.java) has been added to teccli, many
	bugs have been fixed, tecser now provides the same functionality
	as the local-corpus version of teccli, the client has been made
	compatible with JNLP, resource files have been created in
	modnlp/teccli/jnlp. Fixed a bug in TokeniserRegex.java which
	caused all text between empty ignorable tags (e.g. '<omit
	desc="fig"/>') and the next matching closing tag for the same
	element (e.g. '</omit>') not to be indexed. Added functionality to
	Dictionary.java and HeaderDBManager.java which deals with corpus
	file descriptions.

	fixed concordance line display (CorpusFile couldn't read past
	non-ascii characters)
